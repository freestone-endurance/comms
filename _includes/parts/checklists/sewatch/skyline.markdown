- Contact CommsHQ via Discord (if no internet, use inReach)
- Use the Yeti battery to charge devices if necessary

### Protocols

- If you cannot get the Starlink data connection to work with OST Remote, revert to using the Secondary Runner Tracking (see Protocols - Secondary Runner Tracking) by sending a message for every runner to CommsHQ.
- First Runner - Send a message to CommsHQ when the first runner leaves.
- Syncing - Sync OST Remote every opportunity
- Reconciliation - When there are only a few runners left, reconcile your list of runners left with CommsHQ (see Protocols - Reconciliation).
- Last Runner - When the last runner leaves your aid station, text CommsHQ. If CommsHQ agrees, you can start packing up (leaving some supplies out for Sweepers). You cannot close until sweepers are through.
