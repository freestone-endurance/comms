## Discord

We are now using Discord for text-based communication. Discord has a lot of features, so we've established some basic etiquette to keep things organized on race day.

- For most communication, DM @commshq directly.
- The #race-annoucements and #drops channels are for @commshq to use exclusively. Please keep an eye on messages from that channel, but do not chat in there.
- There is a #general channel for your use to communicate with other comms people, directors, and captains on race day.
- Try to thread your direct responses to questions/comments (this keeps the channel clean for multiple discussions at once)
- *Confirming Messages*: To confirm messages, just use the reactions feature. React with a thumbs up emoji to confirm any message. You can do this by tapping and holding on a message, then tapping the thumbs up emoji to react with it.
