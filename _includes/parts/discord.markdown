## Discord

We are now using Discord for text-based communication. Discord has a lot of features, so we've established some basic etiquette to keep things organized on race day.

- For messages about runners, like drops or leaders, please use the race channel.
- For any other communication, please DM @comms directly.
- *Confirming Messages*: To confirm messages, just use the reactions feature. React with a thumbs up emoji to confirm any message. You can do this by tapping and holding on a message, then tapping the thumbs up emoji to react with it.
