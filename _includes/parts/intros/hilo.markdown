**Welcome to the High Lonesome 100 Comms Manual**

Thank you so much for volunteering! The Communications Team (or Comms) is an important part of the race. We are primarily responsible for live runner tracking. Friends and family, as well as race staff, rely heavily on this information to follow their runners through the race. We also provide a vital communications network to handle any emergencies that might occur.

This year, we are making two important changes:

- Using Discord for text communication
  - Your iPads will be pre-loaded with Discord and logged in. If you want to log in from a personal phone, the credentials will be available in the binder.
- Relying primarily on OpenSplitTime for runner tracking, with the Runner Tracking Form as a backup
    - This is because we want you to focus on getting every runner into OST, instead of trying to split time between OST and the written forms. If you have extra people available, writing down times is still helpful to fill in gaps in the data.

Before race day, please read this manual and watch the suggested YouTube videos. On race day, this manual will be available in a binder for your reference.
