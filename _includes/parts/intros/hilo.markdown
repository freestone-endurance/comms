**Welcome to the High Lonesome 100 Comms Manual**

Thank you so much for volunteering! The Communications Team (or Comms) is an important part of the race. We are primarily responsible for live runner tracking. Friends and family, as well as race staff, rely heavily on this information to follow their runners through the race. We also provide a vital communications network to handle any emergencies that might occur.

We now have a [2025 Training Video](https://youtu.be/BYxGBUY5MdI)! It's only 12 minutes long and goes over all the relevant information. Please watch it before race day. After watching, you must [fill out the confirmation survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSea4aA1Z9mMYs_UzBIpvttFMgsAP_F58KWHED-cEBWdR5cD6g/viewform) with the secret word from the training video.
