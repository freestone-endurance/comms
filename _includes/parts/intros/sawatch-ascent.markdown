Thank you so much for volunteering! The Communications Team (or Comms) is an important part of the race. We are primarily responsible for live runner tracking. Friends and family, as well as race staff, rely heavily on this information to follow their runners through the race. We also provide a vital communications network to handle any emergencies that might occur.

We now have a [Training Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCpZaqZhhuE)! It's only 9 minutes long and goes over all the relevant information. Please watch it before race day.
