**Welcome to the 2022 Sewatch Ascent 50k Comms Manual**

Thank you so much for volunteering! The Communications Team (or Comms) is an important part of the race. We are primarily responsible for live runner tracking. Friends and family, as well as race staff, rely heavily on this information to follow their runners through the race. We also provide a vital communications network to handle any emergencies that might occur.

This year, we are making two important changes:

- Using Discord for text communication
- Relying entirely on OpenSplitTime for runner tracking

Before race day, please read this manual and watch the suggested YouTube videos. On race day, this manual will be available in a binder for your reference.
