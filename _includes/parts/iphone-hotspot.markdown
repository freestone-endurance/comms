## iPhone Hotspot

You’ve been provided with an iPhone from Freestone Endurance that has a SIM card in it. Since your aid station has cellular service, we’ll use that device to create a WifI hotspot for the other device(s) to use. Please only use this connection for Comms Team Purposes (i.e. OST syncing and texting with CommsHQ).

Setting up the phone as a hotspot is pretty easy:

- Open the Settings app by tapping on the gears app icon
- Select "Personal Hotspot"
- Toggle “Allow Others to Join”
- Now connect your other devices to the WiFi network using the password on screen.
- Verify your connection by performing an OST Remote "Refresh Data"
- Text CommsHQ telling them you’re online!
