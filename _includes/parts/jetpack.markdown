## Jetpack

You’ve been provided with an Verizon Jetpack from Freestone Endurance that has a SIM card in it. Since your aid station has cellular service, we’ll use that device to create a WifI hotspot for the other device(s) to use. Please only use this connection for Comms Team Purposes (i.e. OST syncing and texting with CommsHQ).

Setting up the Jetpack as a hotspot is pretty easy:

- Just plug in the Jetpack and power it on
- Place the Jetpack in a high location (At Lost Wonder Hut, place it high on the back stairwell)
- Now just join the WiFi
