## Tracking Runners with OST Remote

**[Tracking runners with OST Remote Youtube Video](https://youtu.be/hL4ECiygmpU)**

We track runners when they come in, when they leave, and when and where they drop. We also track whether they have a pacer or not. In the past we have used both OST Remote and a pen and paper form. This year, we are trying out just OST Remote, an app that syncs runner times to the cloud.

### Logging In

When you receive your iOS device(s) from CommsHQ, it will be logged into our account with the `tracking@freestoneendurance.com` account. If it isn’t, go ahead and log in. The credentials will be in the binder.

### Selecting Aid Station

In most cases, this will be done for you by CommsHQ prior to the race. If you have to change aid stations, or if it was done incorrectly, you may have to reselect the aid station to setup the app for entry. Do so in the Utils panel.

### Live Entry

Live Entry is the main view you’ll need to enter runner’s times. When a runner comes in, enter their bib number. Once you’ve selected a bib number, the runner’s name should show up. Double check it’s the correct name with the runner (or the runner tracking sheet). If they have a pacer with them, toggle the Pacer/No Pacer selection. Finally, hit the **[Aid Name] In** button to commit their entry.

When a runner is leaving your aid, do the same as above, selecting the [Aid Name] Out button to commit their entry.

If a runner decides to drop at your aid station (See Drops section), you’ll enter the drop by typing in their bib number, toggling the Continuing/Done selection, and tapping the **[Aid Name] Out** button to commit the drop entry.

Once the **[Aid Name] In** or **[Aid Name] Out** buttons are tapped, the view will reset, preparing you to enter the next runner.

The image below (left) show the Live Entry view for the Raspberry 1 Aid Station. The image below (center left) shows the Live Entry view after typing a bib number in, but before hitting the Raspberry 1 In button. The image below (center right) shows the entry for a runner right after tapping the Raspberry 1 In button, where you can easily tap to make changes, or start typing in another bib number. The final image (right shows that you can enter a time for bib number even if it isn’t on the roster.

### Syncing

You must sync OST Remote in order to upload the runner tracking times to the cloud (and CommsHQ). To get to the Sync page, tap the “Hamburger Menu” in the top right corner, which shows the sidebar menu (image below, left. From there, select Review / Sync to go to the Sync view. If you have unsynced entries, a small red badge will show how many entries are unsynced. See the images below.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/parts/ost-remote/sync-2.png" width="20%"/>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/parts/ost-remote/sync-3.png" width="20%"/>

Once on the Sync view, you will see your unsynced entries (see image above, right). Here, you should review the entries to cross check with your Runner Tracking Form to make sure you have the correct bib numbers, pacer, drops, and times (time accuracy within a few minutes). Now is the easiest time to correct a mistake. If anything is wrong, simply select the entry that you’d like to correct and edit the entry directly. Note the red text says that a Bib was not found. This is not necessarily an error; it could be a new runner and your OST Remote has not had it’s roster updated.


Once you’ve confirmed the data is correct, hit the Sync button. If you get a Success! screen (shown above, right), all those entries are now synced and you can return to the Live Entry screen to prepare for the next runner.

How often should you sync?
* If you are on a good data connection (cellular, Starlink), sync as often as possible!
* If you are on a low/Satellite data connection (iSavi), please sync every 5-15 minutes.

### Roster Update / Refresh Data

As you get your aid station setup with your data connection, part of your getting ready process will be to update the roster (after the race starts. Simply tap the Menu, then Utilities, then Refresh Data.
