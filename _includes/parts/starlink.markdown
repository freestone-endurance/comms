## Data - Starlink

The Starlink is a new SpaceX satellite data system that allows us to create a reliable high-bandwidth connection anywhere with a view of the sky. We can use these to establish excellent connections from anywhere on the course.

### Starlink - Setup

- Find a good spot for the dish with no trees in a 20ftx20ft area near your AS.
- If you have a generator, plug it in to a running generator by using a long extension cord to place the generator away from your AS.
- If you have a battery with solar panel(s), plug it into the battery and set up solar panel(s) (daisy chain them if more than one)
- Connect the router part of the Starlink. The WiFi should start very quickly.
- Connect your device to the WiFi (see Credentials)
- You should have internet now, but it will improve over the next 5-20 minutes as the Starlink adjusts itself.
- Verify you have internet by running a "Refresh Data" in OST Remote
- Let CommsHQ know you're online by texting them (via Discord)
