### Gear List

- Starlink Satellite Terminal
- Big Battery for Starlink
- 2x iPads
- Runner Tracking Forms
- You should bring a chair to hang out in, any snacks to get you through ~4 hours of runner tracking.
- Jon will pick up equipment from you at your location for transfer to Hancock.

### Instructions

*Role*:
- Your role will be to record runner tracking only, no aid.
- You can also act as course marshall to make sure everyone makes the correct turn.
- When you arrive, set up the battery and starlink, send CommsHQ a note saying you're up and running via Discord (on the iPads)
- Your first runner will arrive by 9:30 AM, so make sure you're set up by then. It's about a 20 minute drive from the S/F Line.
- As runners come in, record their tracks in OST Remote. There will be no "inbound" or "outbound" times, just one "Baldwin" time to record for each runner.
- You'll stay there until the last runners come through, expected at roughly 1:45PM, then pack all the equipment up.
- Jon will be driving down from Antero around the last runners and will take your equipment from you there. **Do not drive it back to the S/F line.**

*Location*:
This [google maps link](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zD9byGDbdBmjtxiMA) is a rough location of where we want y'all. You should be along Highway 162 in one of the pull-offs next to the course while the course travels between the bottom of Baldwin Gulch / Mt Antero Road and the Alpine town turnoff. We've attached a picture of what we think the best location is. Caleb may provide some more details.
