### Instructions

*Tasks and expectations*:
One of you will record times with the iPhone and the other will use paper. The purpose of the paper is to help during rushes of runners. So once you have a lull in traffic, double check the iPad and paper to make sure you didn't miss anyone! A training video for using the tracking system is available here. Please watch the video, and then fill out this form. Please sync Skyline info as often as possible, but prioritize getting 100% of the runners

*Timing*:
You need to be in position and connected with CommsHQ by 8am. Course record is around 8:30am. You'll need to stay up there until all the runners are through, then you can head down. We anticipate this to be around 1pm.

*Safety*:
You are above treeline, so in the event of bad weather we want you to drop back down to Antero. There is zero shade, so bring sun protection. We don't have a shelter to send up this year, so I'd recommend pants, long sleeve, and cap. It can also be chilly in the mornings, so bring plenty of layers to stay warm! 

*Miscellaneous*:
- You are a comms checkpoint, not an aid station. So you cannot provide aid to runners. First aid is fine if needed, but you'll want to involve the Antero medical team.
- It is likely that you will encounter one runner who will say they want to drop. Unless that person is past 1:00pm, they are required to continue to Antero and drop there. However, if you drove up and you've got a runner who is past cutoffs and moving super slow, it might be easier to drive them down (assuming you drove up). That is entirely at your discretion however. The sweepers can continue escorting cutoff runners down by foot. Any other runner who tries to drop there should be told no unless it's a medical issue. If you do drive a runner down, stop at Antero to have them fill out a drop form with the Antero AS Captain.

*Closing*:
Please stay until the last runner, around noon, weather-allowing, then hike down to Antero AS, where you can catch a ride. Communicate with CommsHQ on which runner is the last. If you must leave earlier than the last runner, please notify CommsHQ.
